# Iron Gate

Iron Gate is the code name given to a project that will provide convenient and simple tag based file and folder management. This is a cross-platform application for Windows, Mac OSX, and Linux. Some of the main features we are aiming for:
  
  - Inexact search using tags
  - 1 click folder organizer
  - 1 click file/folder tagging 
  - Save folder structures frequently used as templates
  - Search, upload, and download other user directory templates
  - Easily remove unused files and folders
  - ... more to come
  

### Version

### Tech

The following is used to develop Iron Gate:

* [JavaFX] - GUI library
* [JavaFX Scene Builder] - Quick GUI design
